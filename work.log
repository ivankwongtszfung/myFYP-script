use deltatime to calculate the timeInterval
make a class to store all the data with getter and setter
drag object function with gaze control without velocity



#update 
#THE TIME INTERVAL FOR EACH FRAME VARY
#MOVING NON PHYSICS OBJ
#SIMPLE TIMERS
#receiving input

#fixedupdate
#TIME INTERVAL REMAIN THE SAME
#will sync physics engine

#generic term
#could be on every type
#we can constraint the type use "where T: class/struct/new/monobehavior/interface"

#delegate
#pass function as parameter
#pack functions into one if all the functions are staying in the same class
